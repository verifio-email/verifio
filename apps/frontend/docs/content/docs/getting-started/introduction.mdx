## What is Verifio?

Verifio is an email verification API that tells you whether an email address is **real** before you hit send. No more bounced emails, no more wasted credits, no more damaged sender reputation.

## How It Works

Every email goes through our verification pipeline:

```
📧 Email  →  ✓ Syntax  →  ✓ DNS  →  ✓ Checks  →  ✓ SMTP  →  📊 Result
```

In seconds, we check the format, verify the domain, detect disposable addresses, and confirm the mailbox exists — all without sending a single email.

## What You Get

Every verification returns a clear verdict:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ✅ `deliverable` | Safe to send — this email is real |
| ❌ `undeliverable` | Don't send — this will bounce |
| ⚠️ `risky` | Proceed with caution |
| ❓ `unknown` | Couldn't verify — try again later |

Plus a **quality score** from 0-100 so you know exactly how confident you can be.
