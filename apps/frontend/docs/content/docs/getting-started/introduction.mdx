## Why Email Verification Matters

Invalid email addresses harm your business in multiple ways:

- **Bounce rates** damage your sender reputation
- **Spam traps** can get your domain blacklisted
- **Fake signups** waste your marketing budget
- **Poor deliverability** reduces campaign effectiveness

## How Verifio Works

Verifio performs a comprehensive series of checks on each email address:

**Email Input** → **Syntax Check** → **DNS Lookup** → **Disposable Check** → **Role Check** → **SMTP Verification** → **Result + Score**

### 1. Syntax Validation

Checks if the email follows RFC 5322 standards and has a valid format.

### 2. DNS Validation

Verifies the domain exists and has proper MX records configured.

### 3. Disposable Detection

Identifies temporary email providers like Mailinator, 10MinuteMail, etc.

### 4. Role-based Detection

Detects generic role addresses that typically don't belong to individuals.

### 5. SMTP Verification

Connects to the mail server to verify the mailbox exists without sending an email.

## Verification Result

Each verification returns a comprehensive result:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `email` | string | The email address that was verified |
| `state` | string | Primary verdict: `deliverable`, `undeliverable`, `risky`, or `unknown` |
| `score` | number | Quality score from 0-100 |
| `reason` | string | Human-readable explanation of the result |
| `checks` | object | Detailed results for each verification check |
