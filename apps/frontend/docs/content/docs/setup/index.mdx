# Development Setup

Get Verifio running on your local machine for development.

<Callout>
  **Prerequisite:** Make sure **Bun** is installed before starting.
</Callout>

```sh
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

**More details:** [https://bun.sh/docs/installation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

## 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:verifio-email/verifio.git
```

## 2. Navigate to Project Directory

```sh
cd verifio
```

## 3. Install Dependencies

```sh
bun install
```

## 4. Configure Hosts File

<Callout type="warn">
  **Important:** This step is crucial for running multiple services on the same network.
</Callout>

Since Verifio consists of several services (backend, frontend) that need to communicate with each other, you must add a local domain entry to your hosts file.

```sh
echo "127.0.0.1 local.verifio.email" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

**What this does:**
- Maps `local.verifio.email` to your local machine (`127.0.0.1`)
- Enables services to communicate using the same domain name
- Allows proper routing between frontend, backend, and API services via Caddy proxy

**Note:** You may need to enter your system password when running this command with `sudo`.

## 5. Start Docker Services

<Callout>
  **Prerequisite:** Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system.
</Callout>

Start all required infrastructure services:

```sh
bun run docker:up
```

This command will start all the necessary Docker containers for:
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database
- **Redis** - Caching and sessions
- **Caddy** - Reverse proxy for `local.verifio.email`
- **Inngest** - Background job processing

## 6. Setup the Database

Push the database schema and seed initial data:

```sh
bun run db:push
```
*Creates the database tables and schema using Drizzle ORM.*

```sh
bun run db:seed
```
*Populates the database with default/initial data.*

**Open database studio (optional):**
```sh
bun run db:studio
```
*Opens a visual UI for the database using Drizzle Studio.*

## 7. Start Frontend Services

Verifio includes multiple frontend applications. You can start them individually or all together:

**Main Web Application (Public Website):**
```sh
bun run fe:web:dev
```
*Starts the public-facing website on http://localhost:3000*

**User Dashboard:**
```sh
bun run fe:dashboard:dev
```
*Starts the main user dashboard for managing API keys, verification, and usage*

**Documentation:**
```sh
bun run fe:docs:dev
```
*Starts the documentation site on http://localhost:3003*

## 8. Start Backend Services

Verifio's backend consists of several microservices. Start them as needed:

**Authentication Service:**
```sh
bun run be:auth:dev
```
*Handles user authentication, sessions, and permissions*

**Email Verification Service:**
```sh
bun run be:verify:dev
```
*Core email verification engine - syntax, DNS, SMTP checks*

**Workflow Service:**
```sh
bun run be:workflow:dev
```
*Manages bulk verification jobs and background processing*

**API Key Service:**
```sh
bun run be:api-key:dev
```
*Handles API key generation, validation, and management*

**Credits Service:**
```sh
bun run be:credits:dev
```
*Manages credit balances, usage tracking, and billing*

**Logging Service:**
```sh
bun run be:logs:dev
```
*Stores and retrieves verification history and logs*

**Upload Service:**
```sh
bun run be:upload:dev
```
*Handles file uploads for bulk email verification*

**Start all services at once:**
```sh
bun run verifio:dev
```
*Starts all frontend and backend services using Turborepo*

## 9. Service Ports and URLs

When running locally, services will be available at:

| Service | URL | Port | Description |
|---------|-----|------|-------------|
| Web App | http://localhost:3000 | 3000 | Main public website |
| Dashboard | http://localhost:3001 | 3001 | User dashboard |
| Docs | http://localhost:3003 | 3003 | Documentation |
| Auth API | http://localhost:8000 | 8000 | Authentication service |
| API Key API | http://localhost:8012 | 8012 | API key management |
| Logging API | http://localhost:8020 | 8020 | Logging service |
| Workflow API | http://localhost:8017 | 8017 | Workflow service |
| Upload API | http://localhost:8018 | 8018 | Upload service |
| Credits API | http://localhost:8030 | 8030 | Credits service |
| Verify API | http://localhost:3040 | 3040 | Email verification |
| Inngest Dev | http://localhost:8288 | 8288 | Inngest dashboard |

**Via Caddy Proxy (HTTPS):**

| Route | Service |
|-------|---------|
| https://local.verifio.email | Web App |
| https://local.verifio.email/dashboard | Dashboard |
| https://local.verifio.email/docs | Docs |
| https://local.verifio.email/api/auth/* | Auth API |
| https://local.verifio.email/api/verify/* | Verify API |

## 10. Development Workflow

1. **Start Docker services** (PostgreSQL, Redis, Caddy, Inngest)
2. **Setup database** (push schema, seed data)
3. **Start backend services** (auth, verify, workflow, etc.)
4. **Start frontend services** (web, dashboard, docs)
5. **Access applications** at `https://local.verifio.email`

**Quick start commands:**
```sh
# Terminal 1: Start Docker
bun run docker:up

# Terminal 2: Setup database (first time only)
bun run db:push && bun run db:seed

# Terminal 3: Start all services
bun run verifio:dev
```
