## Method 1: Use a Free Email Verification Tool (Recommended)

The easiest way to verify an email address is using an online verification tool.

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to our free email verifier**
   → [tools/email-checker](/tools/email-checker)

2. **Enter the email address**
   ```
   user@example.com
   ```

3. **Click "Verify Email"**
   Wait 1-2 seconds for verification

4. **Review the results**
   - **Status:** Valid/Invalid/Risky
   - **Quality Score:** 0-100
   - **Detailed checks:** Syntax, MX, Disposable, SMTP

5. **Take action based on results**
   - ✅ Valid: Safe to use
   - ❌ Invalid: Remove from list
   - ⚠️ Risky: Use with caution

### What the Tool Checks:

- ✅ **Syntax** - Proper email format
- ✅ **MX Records** - Domain can receive emails
- ✅ **Disposable** - Not a temporary email
- ✅ **Catch-All** - Not an accept-all domain
- ✅ **SMTP** - Mailbox exists and is active

## Method 2: Manual Verification (For Tech-Savvy Users)

If you want to understand the technical process, here's how to verify emails manually:

### Step 1: Check Email Syntax

**Verify the email follows proper format:**

```bash
# Basic format check
user@domain.tld

# Must contain:
- @ symbol (exactly one)
- Local part before @
- Domain name after @
- Top-level domain (at least 2 chars)
```

**Valid examples:**
- ✅ `john.doe@example.com`
- ✅ `user+tag@gmail.com`
- ✅ `test123@company.co.uk`

**Invalid examples:**
- ❌ `user@.com` - Missing domain
- ❌ `@example.com` - Missing local part
- ❌ `user@example` - Missing TLD
- ❌ `user..name@example.com` - Consecutive dots

**Tool:** [Email Syntax Validator](/tools/syntax-validator)

### Step 2: Verify Domain Exists

**Check if the domain is real and active:**

```bash
# On Linux/Mac, run:
nslookup -type=MX example.com

# Or use dig:
dig MX example.com
```

**What you're looking for:**
```
example.com mail exchanger = 10 mail1.example.com
example.com mail exchanger = 20 mail2.example.com
```

**If you see MX records:**
- ✅ Domain can receive emails
- Proceed to Step 3

**If you see "NXDOMAIN":**
- ❌ Domain doesn't exist
- Email is invalid

**Tool:** [Domain Lookup Tool](/tools/domain-lookup)

### Step 3: Check for Disposable Email

**Verify it's not a temporary email service:**

Common disposable domains to avoid:
- tempmail.com
- guerrillamail.com
- mailinator.com
- 10minutemail.com
- throwaway.email

**Check if domain is disposable:**
→ [Disposable Email Detector](/tools/disposable-detector)

### Step 4: SMTP Verification (Advanced)

**Connect to the mail server and verify the mailbox:**

```bash
# Telnet to mail server (if available)
telnet mail.example.com 25

# SMTP conversation:
EHLO yourdomain.com
MAIL FROM: <you@yourdomain.com>
RCPT TO: <user@example.com>
# Server responds: 550 User unknown
# OR: 250 OK (user exists)
QUIT
```

**⚠️ Important:**
- Only do this for emails you own
- Don't spam verification servers
- Use tools instead of manual checks

## Method 3: Bulk Email Verification

Need to verify multiple emails at once?

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Prepare your email list**
   - CSV format recommended
   - One email per row
   - Include header row

2. **Use our bulk tester** (free up to 100 emails)
   → [tools/bulk-tester](/tools/bulk-tester)

3. **Upload your list**
   - Paste emails directly
   - Or upload CSV file

4. **Review results**
   - Valid emails (green)
   - Invalid emails (red)
   - Risky emails (yellow)

5. **Export cleaned list**
   - Download verified emails
   - Remove bad addresses
   - Import to your email platform

## How to Interpret Verification Results

### ✅ Valid/Deliverable

**What it means:**
- Email is properly formatted
- Domain exists and active
- Mailbox can receive messages
- Safe to send emails

**Action:** Keep and use for marketing

### ❌ Invalid/Undeliverable

**What it means:**
- Syntax errors
- Domain doesn't exist
- Mailbox doesn't exist
- Permanent failure

**Action:** Remove from list immediately

**Common reasons:**
- Typos in email (gamil.com vs gmail.com)
- Fake email address
- Person left company
- Domain expired
- Email disabled

### ⚠️ Risky/Unknown

**What it means:**
- Catch-all domain

**Action:** Use with caution or verify again later

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Valid Gmail Address

```
Email: john.smith@gmail.com

Verification:
✅ Syntax: Valid format
✅ Domain: gmail.com exists
✅ MX Records: Found
✅ Disposable: No
✅ SMTP: Mailbox active

Result: VALID (Score: 95)
```

### Example 2: Invalid Email

```
Email: user@gmil.com

Verification:
❌ Syntax: Valid format
❌ Domain: gmil.com doesn't exist (typo)
❌ MX Records: Not found
❌ SMTP: Cannot connect

Result: INVALID (Score: 0)

Issue: "gmil" should be "gmail"
```

### Example 3: Disposable Email

```
Email: temp@mailinator.com

Verification:
✅ Syntax: Valid format
✅ Domain: mailinator.com exists
✅ MX Records: Found
❌ Disposable: Yes (temporary email)
⚠️ SMTP: Mailbox exists

Result: RISKY (Score: 30)

Action: Remove from list
```

## Common Email Verification Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Only Checking Syntax

**Problem:**
```
user@nonexistent-domain.com
```
- Syntax is valid ✅
- But domain doesn't exist ❌

**Solution:** Always verify domain and mailbox

### ❌ Mistake #2: Ignoring Typos

**Common typos:**
- `gmial.com` instead of `gmail.com`
- `yahooo.com` instead of `yahoo.com`
- `hotmial.com` instead of `hotmail.com`

**Solution:** Use verification tools that catch typos

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Verifying at Signup

**Problem:** Bad data enters your database

**Solution:** Add real-time verification to forms

### ❌ Mistake #4: Keeping Hard Bounces

**Problem:** Sending to emails that already bounced

**Solution:** Remove hard bounces immediately

For businesses with large email lists:

### 1. Use an API

Integrate verification into your systems:
